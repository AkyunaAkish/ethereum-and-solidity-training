### Notes from Ethereum and Solidity Training Course

#### Bitcoin History
- October 31, 2008
  - A white paper describing peer to peer payments without a financial itermediary like banks was released
  -  It cited transaction reversals as an issue with online commerce - the ability of customers to charge back a purchase
  - Satoshi Nakamoto released the white paper though the identity of this person or group is unknown
  - Whitepaper: https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf

#### Ethereum History
- Vitalik Buterin(Russian) created Ethereum late 2013
  - Uses 'smart contract' which is code that lives in the Ethereum block chain. These contracts are at the core of what Ethereum is. 
  - Uses the concept of DAC(decentralized autonomous corporations)
    - Basically a corporation split into sub-corporations where decisions are made based on votes from shareholders. Shareholders who own more Ethereum have more voting power.

#### Ethereum Tools
- For Developers to connect:
  - Web3.js
- For Consumers to connect:
  - Metamask(chrome extension)
  - Mist Browser

#### Solidity Smart Contracts
- Written in solidity language(.sol files)
  - Strongly Typed
  - Similar to Javascript(sort of)
  - Gets compiled before deployment
  - Application Binary Interface(ABI)
    - Translates Solidity smart contract byte code to a usable data format for Javascript to use the smart contract
  - Doesn't require long development time
    - More time is invested in writing applications around the Solidity smart contracts that interact with the smart contracts
